How Important is the 3-pointer?
Does a higher 3-pt% lead to more wins?
Imported Team shooting and team records into python from nba_api
Created a database in SQL to analyze NBA teams data based on wins and 3-pt %
Used joins and created new table with combined team records data and team shooting data
Imported .csv below to analyze NBA team data
Found that there is a correlation between higher 3-pt% and wins in the NBA
